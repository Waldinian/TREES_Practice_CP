#Script for converting meteorological data into a TREES driver file
#DSM 2019, updated 2021
#
#This file is for illustrative purposes. It takes a real meteorological file
#with typical variables, and writes out a TREES driver file. Meteorological
#data come in various forms, with different variables, different headings,
#and different units. Consequently, these files are hard to generalize.
#
#What this file does give you is a template for creating a driver file that
#can be read by TREES, a guide to the 

#
#Set working directory and read in an example meteorological data file
#The source file is structured with the following columns:
#Year	
#DOY	
#TIMESTAMP	
#AirTemp_C	
#RH_fraction	
#Vap_Press_kPa	
#HrlySolRad_kJ_m^2_min^1	
#WindSpeed_m_s^1	
#WindDir_Deg	
#WindDir_STDD_Deg	
#Rain-Tot	
#SoilTemp_5cm_C	
#SoilTemp_15cm_C	
#HWG_maxspeed_m_s^1	
#HWG_time	HWG_Dir	
#BaPress_kPa	
#ETr	
#ETo	
#ETr-Daily	
#ETo-Daily	
#Rain-Daily
